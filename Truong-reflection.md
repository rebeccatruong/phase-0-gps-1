What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? **Just getting started with a session in git was a bit confusing**
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? **Git pull vs fetch**
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? **I asked lots of questions! How to create a new branch, switch between branches, a reminder on markups and more**
What still confuses you about Git? **I got a vi error during my merge release which cause a bit of confusion**
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? **Successful. I enjoyed working with y guide and felt like I was able to confirm a few questions I had from the challenges and she taught me a couple shortcuts which was great. Like tab auto-complete!**
